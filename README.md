# gsi-aim-excercises

This repository contains various Jupyter notebooks that i have created to experiment the libraries,exercises as well as the regression models:

## Getting Started:
- 01: [Numpy](https://github.ibm.com/vasinter/gsi-aim-excercises/blob/master/01.%20Numpy/Numpy-Basics.ipynb), a Python extension module for scientific computing.
- 02: [Pandas](https://github.ibm.com/vasinter/gsi-aim-excercises/blob/master/02.%20Pandas/Pandas-Basics.ipynb), module for data manipulation and analysis
  - [Pandas-Excercise](https://github.ibm.com/vasinter/gsi-aim-excercises/blob/master/02.%20Pandas/Excercise/Pandas-excercise.ipynb), demonstrated with citizen CSV data.
  - [Pandas-Excercise-2](https://github.ibm.com/vasinter/gsi-aim-excercises/blob/master/02.%20Pandas/Excercise%202/Excercise%202.ipynb), demonstrated Data Cleaning, Sort, Groupby, Join/Combine, & Exporting Data
- 03: [Matplotlib](https://github.ibm.com/vasinter/gsi-aim-excercises/blob/master/03.%20Matplotlib/Matplotlib-Basics.ipynb), a plotting library for Python 
  - [Matplotlib with Seaborn](https://github.ibm.com/vasinter/gsi-aim-excercises/blob/master/03.%20Matplotlib/Matplotlib%20with%20Seaborn.ipynb), a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics
- 04: [Scikit-Learn](https://github.ibm.com/vasinter/gsi-aim-excercises/blob/master/04.%20Scikit-Learn%20/Scikit-Learn.ipynb), tool for data analysis and data mining.

## Regression Models:

- 05: [Linear Regression](https://github.ibm.com/vasinter/gsi-aim-excercises/tree/master/05.%20Linear%20Regression), models the relationship between two variables by fitting a linear equation to observed data.
- 06: [Ridge Regression](https://github.ibm.com/vasinter/gsi-aim-excercises/blob/master/06.%20Ridge%20Regression/Ridge%20Regression.ipynb), a technique to reduce model complexity and prevent over-fitting which may result from simple linear regression.
- 07: [Lasso Regression](https://github.ibm.com/vasinter/gsi-aim-excercises/blob/master/07.%20Lasso%20Regression/Lasso%20Regression.ipynb ), a regression method that involves penalizing the absolute size of the regression coefficients.
